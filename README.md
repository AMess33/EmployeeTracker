# <Employee Tracker>

## A node application that interacts with an employee Database.

Once you initalize the database in the MySQL shell, you are then able to run a node application that allows you to view company Departments, Roles, and Employees. You can also add new Departments, Roles, and Employees, as well as update the role of existing employees.

- I wanted to see all relavent information about departments, roles and employees.
- I built this to easily track and update Departments, roles, and employees at my company.
- This creates a database to refrence as well as add to and update in order to keep track of all company departments, roles, employees and their salires and managers.
- I learned how to build a database with MySql as well as interact with the database and use MySQL statements to manipulate the data in the database.

Once you create and seed the database through the MySQL shell, you run the node application to see the prompts of availble options to interact with the database. You can view Departments, Roles, and Employee tables in a easy to read and understand table. Once you view any of those talbes, you are prompted with the main menu options again. You can choose to add a department, role, or employee to the database by selecting the option in the prompt menu and filling in the necessary information needed for those tables. Once you create a new entry, you can then View the table you updated to see the updates. If you want to update an employees role, you can do so with the Update Employee Role option. When you update an employee with the subsequent prompts, you can run the View Employees prompt once more to see the updated role id for the employee that was updated.
